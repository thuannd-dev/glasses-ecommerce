# ASP.NET Core 9 Project Rules

- Use C# 13 language features where appropriate
- Follow SOLID principles in class and interface design
- Implement dependency injection for loose coupling
- Use primary constructors for dependency injection
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Prefer record types for immutable data structures
- Prefer controller endpoints over minimal APIs
- Implement proper exception handling and logging
- Use strongly-typed configuration with IOptions
- Use EF Core with performance best practices
- Favor explicit typing, avoid var unless evident
- Make types internal and sealed by default
- Prefer Guid for identifiers

## EF Core Performance

- Use AsNoTracking + projection for read-only
- Use AsSplitQuery for multiple collections
- Optimize only when data volume justifies
